<h1 align="center">Blade</h1>
<p align="center">A sharp programming language for all programmers.</p>

### Blade is not ready for release yet.

# NOTICE: The Blade project will very scarcely(if at all) receive updates anymore, I am moving onto bigger projects. Read the following, please.
The reason Blade became more boring to me is that I tried and tried and tried but could not figure out how to have the entire project written in C.\
The only other option was to use Flex and Bison to create a parser, which made me feel like I took the easy way out, and, after struggling with problems with Flex and Bison, decided to stop updating Blade.

# What is blade?
Blade is a programming language designed for small and big programs, designed to be flexible.\
I will have more infomation once released.



# How should I compile Blade? 
Currently, I chose the Meson build system.\
You can compile by running `meson build`, `cd build`, and `ninja`.
